# Proposal Generator: Overview

## Objective
To develop a web-based proposal generator for an advertising agency, enabling the Account Management (AM) team to input minimal high-level information, leverage an LLM (likely Google Gemini API) to research clients and generate detailed content, and produce a unique, editable HTML proposal page for clients. The tool will streamline proposal creation, support AM logins for tracking, provide unique viewing links with analytics, and allow future client interaction features.

## Key Requirements
1. **Input Process**:
   - AM team inputs via a web form:
     - Client name
     - Primary objective
     - High-level services required
     - Quantified scope of work (e.g., number of assets)
     - Pricing and comments for each service (manually entered in a table)
   - An LLM (likely Google Gemini API) researches the client and generates detailed proposal content, including an executive summary and fleshed-out service details.

2. **Services Offered**:
   - Branding
   - Brand Strategy
   - Campaign or Communication Strategy
   - Omni Channel Campaigns (ATL, BTL, Digital, Social, Activation Ideas)
   - Ad Films (scripting and production)
   - Social Media
   - Influencer Campaigns
   - Web and Mobile Apps
   - Performance Creatives
   - E-commerce Creatives (A+ pages, banners, etc.)
   - Digital Videos (explainers, how-tos, etc.)
   - TVCs

3. **Proposal Content**:
   - **Client Name**: Provided by AM team.
   - **Executive Summary**: Automatically generated by LLM based on client research.
   - **Objective**: Input by AM team.
   - **Scope of Services**: High-level services selected by AM team, with details (e.g., social media page management, content calendars) generated by LLM.
   - **Quantified Scope of Work**: Number of assets (e.g., creatives, videos) input by AM team.
   - **Associated Team**: High-level team structure (e.g., account manager, copywriter, designer) input by AM team.
   - **SLA**: Templated service level agreement covering working hours, holidays, standard operating procedures, and turnaround times.
   - **Inclusions**: Specific deliverables included in the scope.
   - **Exclusions**: Services or deliverables not included.
   - **Commercial Proposal Table**: Table listing selected services, quantities, manually entered prices, and comments.
   - **Notes or Comments**: Additional remarks from AM team.
   - **Payment Details**: Payment terms or instructions.

4. **Output Format**:
   - A unique HTML page for each proposal, accessible via a public URL (e.g., `yourapp.com/proposal/<unique_id>`).
   - AM team edits proposals via a JSON file initially, with potential future support for a WYSIWYG editor.

5. **AM Logins**:
   - Each AM has a login (username/password) to track who creates each proposal.
   - Authentication ensures only logged-in AMs can create or view their proposals.
   - Stored in a database with proposal metadata.

6. **Unique Viewing Links and Analytics**:
   - Each proposal has a unique URL for clients to view the HTML page.
   - Basic analytics track the number of times each proposal link is viewed.
   - Analytics visible to AMs in a dashboard.

7. **Future Features**:
   - Allow clients to mark up proposal sections or leave comments, stored and displayed in the proposal interface.
   - Potential password protection for proposal links.

8. **Pricing**:
   - AMs manually input pricing and comments for each service in a table.
   - Example pricing (for reference, not hardcoded):
     - Social Media: Up to 15 creatives (8 statics, 7 videos, 30s each) for INR 2,25,000, including strategy, page management, and reporting. Individual statics: INR 8,500; videos: INR 15,000.
     - Small Campaign: Strategy, communication space, 4 key visuals, film script, 10 adapts, 5 social posts (up to 2 videos) for INR 3,50,000.
   - Pricing logic TBD; may add predefined tiers later.

9. **LLM Integration**:
   - LLM (likely Google Gemini API, free tier) researches client information for the executive summary and generates detailed content for the entire proposal.
   - Integration deferred until development phase; requires API key.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python) for handling form submissions, LLM API calls, JSON generation, HTML rendering, authentication, and analytics.
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-friendly input form, AM dashboard, and proposal pages. Tailwind provides styling and animations.
- **Database**: SQLite for storing AM user data, proposal JSON, view counts, and (future) client comments. SQLite is lightweight, open-source, and suitable for the expected scale (hundreds of proposals).
- **Hosting**:
  - **GitHub**: Public repo for open-source access, forkable by other agencies.
  - **Digital Ocean**: Droplet for hosting Flask app, React static files, and SQLite database (optional if scaled).

## Open Questions
1. **LLM Integration**:
   - Confirm Google Gemini API usage and API key availability.
   - How to handle cases where client information is sparse or unavailable?
2. **Input Form Design**:
   - How should the service selection and pricing table be structured in the UI?
   - Any specific styling or usability preferences for the AM form?
3. **JSON Structure**:
   - What is the exact schema for the JSON file storing proposal data?
4. **Deployment**:
   - Domain or IP setup for Digital Ocean droplet?
   - Access control for AM logins (e.g., role-based permissions)?
5. **Future Features**:
   - Prioritization of client markup/comments or other enhancements?
   - Requirements for WYSIWYG editor transition?

## Next Steps
- Finalize input form design and JSON structure for proposal data.
- Confirm LLM API (Google Gemini) and test integration.
- Define SQLite schema for users, proposals, and analytics.
- Create `app_architecture.md` to document technical details (Flask routes, React components, database schema).
- Set up GitHub repo with setup instructions for forking.
